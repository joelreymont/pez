Context: docs/testing-plan.md:56 and tools/parity/run.sh:86; cause: need verified external decompyle3 clone + test set list for parity checks; fix: ensure /tmp/python-decompile3 clone via gh and update tool/test list if drift; verification: tools/parity/run.sh resolves decompyle3 and docs list current paths.
