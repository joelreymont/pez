File: test/run_roundtrip.sh or build.zig integration. Current: test_roundtrip.sh exists but manual. Goal: Automate .pyc → .py → .pyc → .py, verify outputs match. Implementation: 1) For each test .pyc, decompile to .py, 2) Recompile with CPython, 3) Decompile again, 4) Compare ASTs or normalize and compare text. Challenges: Bytecode may differ (optimizations), compare semantics not bytes. Priority: P3-LOW. High value for correctness validation.
