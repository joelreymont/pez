File: Create test/match_example.py with match statement, compile with Python 3.10+. Task: Disassemble and document bytecode pattern. Method: 1) Write simple match, 2) Compile to .pyc, 3) Disassemble with dis.dis(), 4) Document opcode sequence, jump table structure, 5) Identify MATCH_* opcodes used. Dependency: None. Output: docs/match-bytecode.md. Priority: P2. Time: <30min.
