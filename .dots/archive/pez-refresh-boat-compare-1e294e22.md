Full context: tools/compare/decompile_dir.py:1, tools/compare/compare_dir.py:1. Cause: new loop-try fix requires updated decompile + semantic compare summary for /Users/joel/Work/Shakhed/boat_main_extracted_3.9. Fix: run decompile_dir to /private/tmp/pez_decompiled_boat8 and compare_dir to /private/tmp/pez_compare_boat8_semantic/summary.json; record counts.
