Review current decompiler modules (src/decompile.zig, src/ctrl.zig, src/cfg.zig, src/stack.zig, src/codegen.zig, src/ast.zig, src/decoder.zig, src/opcodes.zig), compare against existing dots, and produce an ordered plan to reach full Python decompiler functionality. Include mapping to existing dots and identify any missing tasks with concrete file/line context.
