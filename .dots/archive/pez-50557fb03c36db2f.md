File: src/opcodes.zig, src/decoder.zig. Currently: error.UnsupportedPythonVersion for 3.0. Issue: Python 3.0 had unique opcodes, short-lived release. Implementation: 1) Research 3.0 opcode differences from 3.1, 2) Add opcode table for 3.0, 3) Handle magic number detection. Test files: test_empty.3.0.pyc, unpack_assign.3.0.pyc. Priority: P3-LOW. Python 3.0 rarely used in practice.
