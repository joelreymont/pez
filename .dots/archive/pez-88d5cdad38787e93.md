File: src/decompile.zig (pattern detection), src/stack.zig (MATCH_* opcodes). Opcodes: MATCH_CLASS, MATCH_MAPPING, MATCH_SEQUENCE, MATCH_KEYS, GET_LEN, COPY (for subject). Control flow: Match uses jump tables and guard conditions. Implementation: 1) Add MATCH_* opcode simulation, 2) Detect match pattern in CFG (jump table structure), 3) Decompile to match/case syntax. Research: study 3.10+ match bytecode patterns. Priority: P2-MEDIUM. Dependency: stable CFG pattern detection.
