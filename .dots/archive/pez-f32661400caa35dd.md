close-reason: "Deferred - requires structural changes: (1) Add loc:Location to Expr/Stmt, (2) Decode linetable in pyc.Code, (3) Map bytecode offset->line in stack sim, (4) Thread locations through all AST construction, (5) Use in codegen output. Large refactor - coordinate with other features first."

File: src/ast.zig - Each node stores source line/column. Propagate from bytecode line table. Used for error messages and output formatting.
