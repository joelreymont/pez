File: src/decompile.zig or src/stack.zig (comparison expr building). Current status: Unknown if supported. Python: 'a < b < c' compiles to optimized bytecode (1 comparison, 2 jump). Implementation: 1) Detect COMPARE_OP followed by POP_JUMP_IF_FALSE + DUP_TOP pattern, 2) Recognize as chained comparison, 3) Generate 'a < b < c' not '(a < b) and (b < c)'. Test: create chained_cmp.3.11.pyc. Priority: P3-LOW. Nice-to-have for output quality.
