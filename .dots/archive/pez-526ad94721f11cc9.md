File: src/stack.zig (NAMED_EXPR opcode, 3.8+), src/ast.zig (NamedExpr node). Opcode: STORE_NAME/STORE_FAST with value kept on stack (vs consumed). In 3.8+: Uses special NAMED_EXPR marker or pattern. Implementation: 1) Detect named expression pattern in bytecode, 2) Add ast.NamedExpr node type, 3) Generate assignment expr syntax (target := value). Test: create walrus.3.8.pyc with 'if (n := len(x)) > 0'. Priority: P2-MEDIUM.
