File: src/ast.zig:410-428, src/codegen.zig (constant printing) - ast.Constant only supports i64, so pyc.Int.big can't be represented. Add a big-int variant (store pyc.BigInt or decimal string), update deinit/clone, and ensure codegen prints big ints without truncation. Depends on updating stack objToConstant to use this variant.
