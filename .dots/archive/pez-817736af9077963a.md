File: src/cfg.zig - buildCFGWithExceptions needs to add exception handler target offsets as leaders before building blocks. Currently handler offsets may be mid-block. Solution: parse exception table first, collect handler offsets, pass them to buildCFG as extra leaders. Affects: buildCFG signature, buildCFGWithExceptions logic.
