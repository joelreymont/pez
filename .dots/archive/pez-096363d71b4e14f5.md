Blocks 0 keeps detecting itself as try pattern, causing infinite recursion in decompileStructuredRange->decompileTry->decompileStructuredRange. Need to prevent re-detection of already processed try blocks. Files: src/ctrl.zig:484 (detectTryPattern), src/decompile.zig:803 (decompileStructuredRange), src/decompile.zig:656 (decompileTry). Root cause: detectTryPattern returns same block_id pattern every time when called on block 0, so next_block never advances.
