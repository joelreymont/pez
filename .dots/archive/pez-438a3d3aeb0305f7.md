File: src/cfg.zig:~506 - Crash after copying successors when adding exception edge. Investigate: memcpy/alloc issue, or accessing block fields during iteration. Current: exception handler offsets are added as leaders, blocks split correctly, but crash when adding exception edges. Crash at block 3 -> 4 edge.
