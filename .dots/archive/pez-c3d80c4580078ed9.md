File: src/dom.zig - Implement dominator tree computation (iterative algorithm) and natural loop detection. A block B is in loop L iff header H dominates B and B can reach H. This fixes the block boundary bug in decompileForBody where exit blocks are incorrectly included in loop bodies. Prerequisites for SSA if needed later.
