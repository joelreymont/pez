File: test/run_version_matrix.sh (NEW) or integrate into build.zig. Goal: Test same .py source across Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13. Implementation: 1) For each Python version, compile test.py to .pyc, 2) Decompile with pez, 3) Compare outputs (should be equivalent modulo syntax changes), 4) Report version-specific failures. Priority: P2-MEDIUM. Validates multi-version correctness.
